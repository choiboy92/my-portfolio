          <p>My name is Junho Choi and I am a 4th year Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate at Imperial College London. Alongside my studies, I have been working as a Product Manage at DoubleMe since July 2020.<br/><br/>
              Along with engineering, I have a keen interest in design, machine learning, front- end web development and computer vision. These wide-ranging interests have lead me to take part in a variety of projects as part of my coursework, internships, and even individual projects that I have started in my free time.
