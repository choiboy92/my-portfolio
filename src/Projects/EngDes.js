          <h1 className="sectionTitle">Research & Review</h1>
          <p>
            When given a design project, experience has helped me learn that although it is easy to
            run into the design process headfirst, this almost always elongates the design period
            and leads to more time spent redesigning afterwards.<br/>
            Part of this process includes reinstating and distilling down the project objectives; an often
            overlooked yet essential part of the project, especially for the team as whole to be on the
            same page:<br/>
            <ol style={{marginLeft:"10%", listStyleType:"none"}}>
              <li>  ðŸ›¡      PROTECTION</li>

              <li>  ðŸ§±      INTERFACE</li>
            </ol>
            I delegated research on these three objectives between the team members, exploring existing solutions,
            research and documentation so we could approach the initial design phase as informed as possible.

            Leading on from our research, the team and I looked to develop some concept sketches exploring various actuation methods,
            deployment methods, shapes & forms, damping methods.

              <p><br/>Simple SDOF models were used to evaluate the vibration transfer from the rocket, throught the deployment system to the satellite.
                By selecting Neoprene rubber (NBR) sheets to dampen launch vibrations and forces, the natural frequencies were reduced to roughly 25 to 30Hz with significant attenuation beyond that.

              <p><br/>Implementing the protective damping would be of little use if the satellite was not secured and fixed within the deployment system.
                PTFE coated railings provide the constrainment as well as the smooth interface allowing the satellite to slide out and acting as a barrier to protect against cold-welding.

              <p><br/>
                Burn-wire device was designed as a simple and reliable way for releasing spring-loaded actuation.
                Its ability to actuate in zero-gravity, non-atmospheric conditions along with the option for contingency burn-wires and their relatively cheap cost,
                makes it an ideal, reliable way for deployer actuation.<br/>
                Consisting of a ceramic holder and shoulder screws, the Nichrome cutting wire was calculated to cut the Vectran cable with between 1 to 2A of current.

                  A simple pulley test was devised as a way to simulate the low gravity environment that the system
                  would experience during the deployment phase. Thus, the real separation velocity could be estiamted in
                  a simple manner while any interference with the railings could also be caught.

            <h1 className="sectionTitle">Challenges of virtual working</h1>
            <p>
              The pandemic that plagued most of 2020 and 2021 meant that all project proceedings had to be carried out online.
              This posed some major challenges, some of which were as simple as sharing unrotated images to more complicated ones.
              Here are some of the major challenges that we faced and learned from.

                <br/>
                MEETINGS & ORGANISATION<br/>
                Conversations and discussions that could be held in a moment or at the end of a lecture were no longer possible.
                The virtual conditions meant greater emphasis on meeting preparation, agendas as well as flexibility to converse via chat so as not to waste time.
                When communicating with other subteams working on other systems, this was vital.
                <br/>
                VIRTUAL CAD<br/>
                A key aspect of projects is using CAD, both for actual design as well as helping members visualise solutions.
                File naming, organisation and version management became as important as ever. Limitations in access to CAD on home computers
                meant that we also had to be flexible and sensible when delegating CAD tasks.
                <br/>
                MANUFACTURING<br/>
                In order to have our design manufactured, we now needed to work with 3rd party prototype vendors. Typically we would build these ourselves in the workshop but due to
                this change we needed to focus on making our engineering drawings had to be of industry standard and familiarising ourself with billing methods.
                Moreover, the higher manufacturing costs meant a greater focus on cost-reduction in our design.
                <br/>
                THE LOSS OF SIGHT & TOUCH<br/>
                Having gone virtual, we realised how much of an advantage it was to be able to simply look and feel a design or prototype. Often during this time,
                we could notice things to change but without this reference, we needed to ensure that our design was close to perfect from the get-go and that we had
                considered all the design and manufacturing requirements; much like what would be expected in industry.
